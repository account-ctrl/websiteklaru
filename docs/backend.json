    "reasoning": "The Firestore data structure is designed to manage pages and services for the KlaroGov application. It prioritizes security, scalability, and debuggability by adhering to Authorization Independence (CRITICAL), Clarity of Intent, DBAC (Database-Based Access Control), and QAPs (Rules are not Filters) design principles.\n\n**Authorization Independence and QAPs:** Authorization independence is achieved by avoiding hierarchical authorization dependencies (`get()` calls in security rules). Since the requirements don't explicitly define user roles or ownership for pages and services, a global access model is assumed. If specific authorization rules are needed (e.g., only admins can create/update pages or services), consider a separate `/roles_admin/{uid}` collection to check for admin privileges without relying on data within page or service documents. If specific users need access only to certain services a membership map should be used to define access privileges (see strategy C).\n\nThe structure supports required QAPs by segregating different data types into separate collections (`pages` and `services`). Each collection maintains a homogeneous security posture, simplifying security rules. The `services` subcollection can securely list operations because access control is based on whether a user has a role (e.g., admin) or membership, which can be enforced at the collection level.\n\n**Data Clarity and Predictability:** Explicit state modeling is not applicable in this case, but predictable schema is enforced. Semantic naming conventions are used for collections and documents (e.g., `pages`, `services`)."
